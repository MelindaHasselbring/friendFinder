Week of 13 HW: Friend Finder - Node and Express Servers


# Friend-Finder

This app is a compatibility-based application. To determine the user's most compatible friend, it takes the user's survey result, then compare their answers with those from other users then calculates the total difference.  The closest match will be the user with the least amount of difference.

The app will then display the name and picture of the user with the best overall match.
